## Roadmap

### **Due to crashing issues with the game, and the overall direction the game is heading - I have quit VALORANT for now**

- ~~Add ability to share current match via Discord Webhook~~
- ~~Show latest played game (with **Cypher** running) info~~
- ~~Downloading all the needed assets like Agent portraits and backgrounds to decrease image loading issuse~~
